# RetroRampage
A simple arcade game

**Objective**: Complete all levels by collecting all blue crystals on each level. For speedrunners, try to do so with the highest score possible.

The user can perform the following movements:
**UP Arrow**: Move up one square<br />
**DOWN Arrow**: Move down one square<br />
**LEFT Arrow**: Move left one square<br />
**RIGHT Arrow**: Move right one square<br />
**SPACE Key**: Shoot a pea<br />
**ESCAPE Key**: Restart the level (losing a life and all previous progress on the level)<br />
**Q Key**: Quit the game<br />

**More Details**:
The player can move a blue marble onto a pit, which results in an empty square. The player can pick up goodies (extra life, health restore, and ammo).
Once a level has been completed, an exit will appear -- the player must navigate to the exit without dying, or the level will be restarted.
