# RetroRampage
A simple arcade game

Objective: Complete all levels by collecting all blue crystals on each level. For speedrunners, try to do so with the highest score possible.

The user can perform the following movements:
UP Arrow: Move up one square
DOWN Arrow: Move down one square
LEFT Arrow: Move left one square
RIGHT Arrow: Move right one square
SPACE Key: Shoot a pea
ESCAPE Key: Restart the level (losing a life and all previous progress on the level)
Q Key: Quit the game

More Details:
The player can move a blue marble onto a pit, which results in an empty square. The player can pick up goodies (extra life, health restore, and ammo).
Once a level has been completed, an exit will appear -- the player must navigate to the exit without dying, or the level will be restarted.
